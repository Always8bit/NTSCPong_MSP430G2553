A COUPLE OF THINGS
------------------
My code is laced with outdated comments and
poorly written code. I probably even did 
programming tricks in it that are shuned upon, but I 
still doubt I'll ever get around to fixing it up. I am 
providing the code AS IS and without warranty. I am 
not responsible for any damage caused directly or 
indirectly by the provided code. Please use it at your 
own risk. 

Without the gracious help of my mentor, none of 
this would have been possible, he taught me how to 
write assembly in a matter of about 5 months, two 
hours a day, once a week. Learning a programming 
language like assembly in this short time definetely 
leaves a lot of room for error. My code is no where 
close to perfect at its best. I am only providing it for 
educational purposes.

Thank you for your time and interest!
